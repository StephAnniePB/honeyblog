<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">This February I am giving myself the ultimate gift; I am changing my name. Shedding the last vestiges of abuse and returning to my roots. I was born July 26th 1979 in Atlanta, Ga. and given the name Stephanie Ann Brown. At ten, when I was forced to take the surname of Pamperin I vowed that one day I would return myself to my rightful name and find my family. It has been a long journey but this February I get to keep my vow.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Returning to my original name will enable me to finally get the records that the State of Ga. has on me without having to go there and physically get them. Not that I have a problem returning to the city of my birth but all my efforts to do so have been thwarted and so I have devised another way. In 2008 when I learned I have Lupus and that it is hereditary possible scenarios of how I became a ward of the state of Ga. begin marinating in my mind. It is my current belief that my mother had Lupus and it caused complications which led to me being born with Cerebral Palsy. I have always believed that something happened to my parents which prevented them from attending the court session that led to the revocation of their parental rights.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">I am both excited and terrified to see if my theories are correct. I want to know the truth of what happened but I also want the two pictures I have of my parents to be more than images of nameless strangers.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Either way in February I will file for the name change and begin the discovery of my roots.<o:p></o:p></span></div></div>
