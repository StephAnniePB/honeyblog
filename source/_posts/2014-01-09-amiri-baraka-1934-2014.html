Today, we lost a Poet. This truth teller told us to unplug from the Matrix long before Hollywood.<br />He put pen to paper to tell us Black is beautiful. Black is bold. Black is resistance. Black is fearless. Black is revolution.<br />Today we lost a Poet. A prophet who like so many was silenced because he refused the status quo. &nbsp;Ancestor those of us who know you stood in the gap for us say thank you. Thank you for being fearlessly strong. May the ancestors welcome you home.<br />Today, we lost a Poet.</div>
