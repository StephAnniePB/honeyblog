Today I did it. I sat face to face with a young lady and explained why she would be wise to take a chance on me. I explained that though my journey has not been a straight one&nbsp;I have made the best of every opportunity. Today I did it. I reached a goal and secured a life while knowing there is more to be done. Today I did it..........then there was the pause.<br />The pause whispered "You are not alone." So I took a deep breath and looked up at the sky murmuring thank you. Thank you for hearing me say that I was willing to put in the hard work. Thank you for guarding the dreams, sheltering the hopes and wiping the tears. Thank you; Universe. Thank you; Karma. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</div>
