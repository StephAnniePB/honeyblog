The color purple; a joining of sky's brilliant blues and earth's robust reds has the meaning of compassion. These past two weeks as I have began identifying the many health concerns preventing me from returning to my baseline I realized my life is a study in purple. The most recent adventure began when I had been diagnosed with walking pneumonia and my doctor prescribed a seven day course of antibiotics. Since my money's been funny lately I was unable to get a cab and go get my medicine. At first I panicked and then I reached for the phone and called a friend of mine. She agreed to come on Saturday and take me to the pharmacy. Now, when my my doctor called to tell me about the course of treatment he said he had called in the prescription to the UW West Clinic on Junction Rd. I am sure that if I had been on my game I would have corrected him and asked that he send it to a different location but I did not.<br />So Saturday we are driving to the clinic and when we arrive it is absolutely deserted. There are no cars in the parking lot &nbsp;and I get this eerie feeling despite it being a beautiful day. At this point because I am tired I suggest to my friend that we try again Monday.<br />Her face says &nbsp;"Are you crazy?"<br />I call the pharmacy I normally do business with and they agree to fill my prescription in thirty minutes. In the meantime my friend decides that a trip to Copps is in order. Thirty minutes and three bags of groceries later we arrive at the pharmacy to pick up my meds.<br />Later in the week this same friend would take me to my appointment with the cardiologist. My doctor is concerned that Lupus is attacking my heart and so he decided to do a drug-induced stress test. In the appointment the nurse was trying to make small talk. This is an activity I normally stay away from because my responses are no where near typical. However, that day I indulge her and she says<br />"Man, I thought this was going to be a happy story."<br />I almost come out the bag on her and then I remember that I know Jesus. After allowing myself some deep breaths I calmly explain that despite the difficulties I face God has always put people in my life who are willing to help me on my journey. Sometimes they stay and contribute a continuous thread into my life's tapestry and other times they come for a period of time and then leave. But whomever they are and however long they stay they are always there at the right moment.<br />When I got home my words to her were marinating in my brain. I am at a particularly difficult part of my memoir and writing it has become painful because I am trying to convey the great divide between myself and those around me at the time I arrived in West Bend, Wisconsin.<br />Then in the middle of the night it hits me; my life has been a study in purple. The color purple; a joining of the sky's brilliant blues and the earth's robust reds has the meaning of compassion. I let this marinate in my mind and then I realize that I can tell this portion of my story without bitterness if I frame it through the people God placed in my life at the time who nourished my soul.<br /><br /></div>
