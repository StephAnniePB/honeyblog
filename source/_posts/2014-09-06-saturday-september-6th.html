A funny thing happened to me as I was working on my memoir. The story I thought &nbsp;I was writing has morphed into something else. &nbsp;Honestly, my first draft was a temper tantrum on paper and my second draft was not much better. I realize now that those first drafts had to be written to reach the vulnerability beneath. I also realize my mental household is shifting. I am shedding the skin of abuse and neglect on a whole different level.<br />I am grateful for the process; I have faith in the process; I will rise through the process. I am thankful.</div>
