<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Hennessy No Ice......<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal"><br /></div><div class="MsoNormal">Hennessey heats my blood igniting a warmth I swore only his hands could create. I am here to reminiscence...remember feeling him. It takes two to trouble trouble and I troubled ‘til I trembled.... Bad boys are addictive. I have let him go but I don't want others knowing what he knows...<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Knowing and knowledge aren’t the same sometimes sex is about the details. Perceptiveness is rewarded here. Takes a special someone to understand why affections flame passions and pursued passions flame freedom.<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Freedom to be top to your bottom; bottom to your top. Freedom to knead the need roiling through my veins without fear that outside this place things will change.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">Opportunity knocked; He pursued, persisted, and prevailed. I released life’s lessons, leaned into chance’s embrace, hoping lust could teach me something.&nbsp; Vulnerabilities vary. He’s ill-equipped to handle this hunger to belong.&nbsp; Ill-prepared to bear the strength of my submission upon his shoulders. First truth chaser swallowed down.......<o:p></o:p></div><div class="MsoNormal">My body has a memory; tactile sensations simmer slowly. His warmth seeps into my skin. The scent of him; an unknown after-shave haunting as his whiskers nick me. Tickling their way to my thighs it's a shame he's a boy in disguise. He lacks a man's maturity. I am left pondering the difference between thirty-one and twenty-three. Second truth chaser swallowed down...<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal">Hennessey heats my blood arousing an anger I rarely let free. He wants to be friends with me. Mirthless laughter leaves my lips. Like I can forget he's the spoon and I'm the ice cream. He double-dipped his spoon in the pleasure of me then.... I tip the bottle of Hennessey only to realize it's empty.<o:p></o:p></div></div>
