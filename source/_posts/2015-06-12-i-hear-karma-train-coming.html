I thought of you as awake; someone I could accept Master Card from until I realized you did not want to be Master nor Commander of your fate.<br /><div>I thought of you as awake; someone I could tear down the walls for until I realized you were a mere mirage; a fake.<br />I thought of you as awake; then I saw you would rather steal from me than build with me.<br />I hear the Karma Train Coming...... moving stealthily unhurried by your arrogance.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
