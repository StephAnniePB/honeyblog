Today marks the sixth year anniversary of my move to Madison. Six years; wow! Time has definitely flown and though not all of it was fun it did lead to my being able to have a home. As I sit in my living room enjoying the first day of 2014 I am pleased and excited that I get to continue shaping this space into something that says "mine."<br />In my minds eye I see the remaining bookshelves assembled and arranged. I see two comfortable soft leather chairs and lamps admitting soft light into the room. Lots of throws and blankets. The posters on the wall are inspiring something that makes you smile and think when you see them.<br />It will be tastefully simple when it is all completed and the best part is it should keep me busy until I return to school in August.<br />Other projects include returning my name back to that which my parents gave me and stepping up my efforts to find them. It is past time for the two strangers in the photographs I have to be named.<br />Then, there is writing. My goal in this arena is very simple I would like to take this year and finish my memoir. It's odd to say that because technically I will only finish it when I am no longer breathing as it is the story of my life. I feel that I can bring it to a closing when I graduate with my degree from the university of my choice. If I can complete what is already a six thousand word manuscript this year then next year I can begin the search for publication.<br />To help me stick to writing everyday I have joined a group on Facebook where I will be held accountable for writing my memoir daily.<br />Other goals in this arena include writing in this blog daily. On January 1st 2015 I want to be able to see 364 days of blogging here. There is never a shortage of things to write about so I feel confident that I can do it.<br />Other than that I am looking forward to the joy, surprises and lessons of 2014.<br /><br /></div>
