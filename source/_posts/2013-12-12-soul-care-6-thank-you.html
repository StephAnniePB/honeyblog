<div class='post'>
Thank you to a friend who will remain nameless because he insists upon it. Thank you for helping me do things without judgement or distaste. Thank you for respecting my need to be independent though I struggle under the weight of Lupus. Thank you for your kindness, patience, understanding and humor. Thank you for not treating me like a charity case. Thank you.&nbsp;<div><br /></div></div>
