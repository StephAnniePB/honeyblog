<b><u>Day 12: Labor Intense Gratitude</u></b><br />This morning I had watermelon for breakfast and I was instantly happy. Today I spent time researching general information on ways to move closer to the vegetarian side of things. I am already living in that arena now I want to see if I can become a permanent resident. I only allow myself to have meat once a week because I am afraid that my iron levels will be too low if I remove it completely. Also certain times during the week I will crave seafood; especially fish and shrimp. Honestly, one of the reasons I miss the South so much is the fresh catch of the day. Up here those are just words but at home they are a reality. Sigh. Anyways I am still on the fence food wise so I say I am mostly vegetarian.<br />Food aside; today I sent out recommendation requests for my UW application. Now, all I have to do is send in the requests for transcripts and then it is out of my hands. I am relieved and terrified at the same time. I have reservations about the accessibility of campus but I know it is the only place I can go to receive my majors. Plus I am leaning more and more towards library science for graduate school. Deep breath. I have to become an undergrad first. Smiling at myself because I can already see me working and living in D.C. That is the goal.<br />I am proud that I have taken this step towards shaping my reality. There is a lot of hard work ahead of me but I welcome it. I am thankful today was a good productive day. I look forward to tomorrow.</div>
