That moment you slip among the trees to tell them your troubles; feeling normal is just around the corner yet unable to find its rhythm where you were last. I want to wake up and hear your laugh, see your smile or hear you tell me one more time to be myself. I want your wisdom and love bottled.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #141823; font-family: helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.3199996948242px;"><br /></span></div>
