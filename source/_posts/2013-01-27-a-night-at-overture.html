I know it's Super Bowl Sunday with much of the masses transfixed in front of the television oohing and aahing over the game or the half-time show. However, there are some in the community who came together in the&nbsp;rotunda of the Overture Center to speak on the subject of Black History. Poets and listeners alike gathered in the rotunda to contemplate the path to freedom and ask themselves if we are truly free. Former Madison Poet Laureate gave us a front row seat to the 1918 lynching in Valdosta, Ga. of Mary Turner; helping us understand that Freedom is never free. Even with the reminder at the end of the night she had me longing for collard greens and Southern Hospitality while she read a piece called Southern Love.<br />Madison's Poet Laureate connected us to the past while Willie Wright brought us to the present. &nbsp;Mr. Wright &nbsp;grounded us in the here and now. Giving us a front row seat to his life in New York, NY; he gave us a glimpse of his&nbsp;psyche which made me smile because intelligence is truly intriguing when used to expand the minds of others.<br />I was still savoring his words when Blu Phoenix took the stage. Proudly expressing the joy felt when President Obama stood in support of a person's right to love and marry whomever they choose; Blu Phoenix &nbsp;skillfully wove the words of President Obama second&nbsp;inauguration speech, the words of Dr. King written from a&nbsp;Birmingham jail and personal reflection. &nbsp;Blu Phoenix issued a challenge to Madison's Poetry community reminding us that when we exclude people based on certain parts of their identity we fail to follow the words penned by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, &nbsp; that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."<br />I got chills watching Blu Phoenix bravely stand at center stage and proclaim the right to accept every piece of &nbsp;identity intersecting through life. I was proud to say we are friends.<br />Many more poets left impressions too among them was a young lady who did a piece about rainbows. It was so touching to me I thought I would cry.<br />When I took the stage my voice shook and I grabbed the podium to support legs that had forgotten their function was to keep me standing. I thought for sure I would throw up because none of my support system had been able to attend and though I respect every poet that took the stage we aren't exactly familiar. My person of romance had left me a word of encouragement on my phone and my best friend was there in spirit. I spoke slowly&nbsp;deliberately tasting each&nbsp;syllable and before I knew it the audience was applauding and I felt the best feeling.<br />I was proud of myself for not letting fear stop me from taking this opportunity. If you are ever in Madison you should drop by for a night in the Rotunda Room at the Overture. The event is free and the next one is scheduled Sunday, March 24th&nbsp;@ 5:30 pm.<br /><br /></div>
