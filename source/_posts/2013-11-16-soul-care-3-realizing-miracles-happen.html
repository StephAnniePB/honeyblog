I once told a friend of mine that miracles happen everyday you just have to be paying attention. Today was just such a day for me. God is constantly putting me around the right person at the right time. This got me thinking I can't be the only one who has God Moments.. You know those moments when you have reached the end of your ropes and when you are ready to say, "That's it! I've had it!" a long time friend will call or stop by and &nbsp;renew your strength.<br />&nbsp;I am glad that God has placed these types of people in my life. From the ones who will listen to me vent about how tired I am of being sick to the ones who will call to check on me even though they live far away. To those who do things like take me to the UW Hospital cafeteria for carrot cake or send me books they think I will find interesting through the mail. I love that each and everyone of you is in my life. Today I was able to accomplish a great portion of my to do list thanks to the kindness and generosity of a friend. My cup truly runneth over.<br />I know the world would have you believe that it is impossible for humankind to get along but I disagree. I have seen in my thirty-four years the great capacity humankind has when they decide to focus on that which unites us and not what divides us.<br />I am currently reading Huey P. Newton's <i>To Die For The People. </i>I am taking it slowly teasing out the tidbits of wisdom tucked between its pages and the one thing that keeps hitting me is how close the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Ten-Point Program are to each other. I can't help but wonder what would happen if we first realized miracles happen everyday and then took that knowledge and used it to respect everyone's humanity.<br />Today I noticed the miracle that happened and I came a step closer to respecting the humanity of another. Today was a good day.</div>
