<div class='post'>
As I prepare to close my eyes tonight I find myself deeply grateful for the passionate curiosity which keeps me searching for my bloodline. I am grateful for following my instinct to write my story down on paper and I am grateful for ignoring the little voice urging me to stop pressing word keys. Today was a hard day because things I thought had been taken rose to the surface; as did the tears.<br />At first I was upset about the tears because I do not cry. Or I did not cry. Now is different. I am finding myself shedding tears more and more as I write. I am grateful because I can cry now and I could not then.<br /><br /></div>
