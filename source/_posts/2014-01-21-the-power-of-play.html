There are those who will tell you that playing is just for children but I disagree. As a writer I have strengthened my skill and customized my craft by playing Scrabble, Boggle, Banana Grams, &nbsp;Words with Friends and Alpha Jax. These games when played with the right opponent can increase vocabulary and give you a bigger arsenal for writing. <br />Other games like Story Cubes, Dinner Box of Questions, and Loaded Questions are all good games for sparking the mind enough to put pen to paper. Plus, you can use each of these individually or with a group.<br />Don't underestimate the power of play when it comes to writing and remember to have fun regardless of whether you choose to put pen to paper.</div>
