Today December 4th marks the anniversary of the deaths of Chairman Fred Hampton Sr and Mark Clark. These men were members of the Black Panther Party. It is 2013 and I cannot help but notice that we are still fighting the same battles. We are still fighting for housing; medical care; living wages; education- both primary and secondary. I say "we" because I am a part of the collective and as such we are still fighting. However, I am saddened because I recognize that a lot of the places we in the black community previously turned to for guidance have been inhaled by capitalism. Even as I shake my head at this predicament I know I cannot quit. The places from which I draw strength are not the same as they were in childhood and often times it feels like I am alone. Then the anniversary of something like this happens and I remember whose blood is running through my veins. We are still fighting. We will still fight. We have always fought.</div>
