Begin with a large hot skillet; northerners know these as frying pans. Add spinach leaves and sliced mushrooms. Throw in some onion and stir until the pan is happy. You will know this because the pan will sizzle and your kitchen will smell like the wilderness mixed with butter and seasonings. Always use salt and pepper when preparing food this ensures that you will not need salt and pepper shakers at the dinner table. Cook the mixture until the onions are translucent; the spinach is wilted and the mushrooms are brown. &nbsp;Now I had some left over chicken drumsticks which I de-boned and &nbsp;added into the mixture. I was going to put it over rice but then I decided I wanted pasta instead. I cooked the penne noodles and then I added the mixture and to that I added two cans of tomato sauce and one can of tomato paste.&nbsp;<div>This Saturday Lunch was a hug from the inside out. My kitchen is sanctuary. It doesn't mind if I re-enter it after five minutes or two days. I know that I can enter in and release the stress of a day or a week without judgement. Here, I know that if I put milk in a saucepan on a low simmer and add cocoa powder and peppermint with a little water I will have a drinking chocolate better than any on the market.&nbsp;</div><div>Here, I do not have to worry about whispers or stares. I can take my time; work at my pace. Here, I know that if I let butter soften and mix it with granulated sugar I have the beginnings of the softest chocolate chip cookies. I love knowing that when I follow a recipe that I have committed to memory I get exactly what I want.</div><div>I have been thinking more and more about what I want my life to be. Actually I have been realizing that my life no longer has to be something I didn't choose. I choose to surround myself with books, music, and movies. I choose to write daily and spend as much time in my kitchen as possible. I choose to live quietly surrounded by those who will give me hugs when I need them whether I ask or not.&nbsp;</div><div>I am learning to nurture the peace, love and happiness inside.</div></div>
