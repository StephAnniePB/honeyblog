<div class='post'>
Three days into my YWCA YWEB class and I feel like I might get the hang of this after all. Having never seen this before I am proud I have come this far. It is strange looking at code when you've never seen it before. I am trying to figure out if this is something I can grasp enough to carve out a career or maybe use as a spring board to sustain myself while I continue pursuing my passion. I am a writer first and foremost so it will be interesting to see where this thread takes me.<br />Right now I am wondering if I could benefit from Code Academy or Khan Academy so I can immerse myself in this world.</div>
