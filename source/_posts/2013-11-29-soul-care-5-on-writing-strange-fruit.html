I am a writer which means I have been blessed with the ability to live life twice. I have also been blessed with the ability to live lives other than my own simply by picking up a book or pressing pen to paper. However, my recent project is not one that allows me to escape the confines of my reality. My recent project is a memoir which is forcing me to deal with wound cleaning. Over the years I have tired many things to clean and heal the wounds of abandonment, abuse and neglect; each method has had varying degrees of success. I must say that putting pen to paper has given me a peace few other things have. Writing my memoir has put me back in touch with the pieces of myself that I thought were eaten away in the wake of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This process has finally allowed me to have my say. State how the world is for me on a daily basis and not just expose the darkness but remember where I find the light.<br />I realized that my being able to survive the darkness had everything to do with where I found the light. An abusive situation meant to punish actually allowed me to read and re-read The Bible; in turn giving me the ability at an early age to decide what kind of person I wanted to become. Books have always been a source of light to me.<br />As I cleanse my wounds and tell the story of me I am realizing that it is as much a love letter to the authors, poets, and musicians whose work remains with me as it is to myself. It is my acknowledgement that fair did not show up at the table. It is also my acknowledgement that I continue to be strong enough to be my own champion.<br />For that knowledge I am blessed and I continue to work through the wounds so I may make the journey easier for another.</div>
