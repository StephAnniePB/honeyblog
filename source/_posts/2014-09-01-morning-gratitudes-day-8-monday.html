<b><u>Day 8: Monday, September 1, 2014</u></b><br /><br /><ol><li>I am thankful for a peaceful nights sleep.</li><li>I am thankful for the ability to help a friend in their time of need.</li><li>I am thankful for the opportunity to apply for admission into the University of Wisconsin Madison.</li><li>I am thankful to have some of what I want and everything I need.</li><li>I am thankful for the opportunity to spend time with my elders.</li><li>I am thankful that my purpose is my passion.&nbsp;</li><li>I am thankful for pen and paper.</li><li>I am thankful for the written word.</li><li>I am thankful for libraries&nbsp;</li><li>I am thankful that hard work always bears fruit.</li></ol><br /><br />Last night I had to help a friend in crisis which prevented me from writing my evening gratitudes. Being grateful does not mean life will not hand me lemons; it means I will be better able to make lemonade. I will continue to post morning and evening gratitudes as well as poetry and Soul Care segments.</div>
