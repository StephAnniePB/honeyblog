The perfect Saturday has eluded me lately. Mostly because without my medicine all my body wants to do is sleep. &nbsp;Hopefully the insurance fiasco will be sorted soon and I will be able to resume my life as a student. Until then days like these are golden. I had the perfect Saturday. Classical music and light jazz. Pumpkin Spice Chai tea and a brand new volume of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's the Complete Sherlock Holmes. The best part was that I did not have to leave my house to have such a luxurious day. Another wonderful thing was that a friend dropped by but instead of expecting to be entertained he brought a book with him and read while I read mine. It was awesome. I do not have many friends with whom I could have experienced a day like today.<br />This Saturday gave me a glimpse into how I want to spend many more days.</div>
