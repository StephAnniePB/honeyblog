I have yet to meet a writer who hasn't come up against the mental prison known as writer's block. For me writer's block isn't a lack of ideas, it's wanting everything laid out perfectly in my mind before pressing pen to paper. The fact that that never happens can cause me not to want to sit down and bleed during the time it takes to complete one page. However, I found that writing prompts can take me out of my head and away from the need for perfection. I have come up with my own set of prompts. Feel free to use them for your own and if you come up with more let me know.<br /><br />1. Your power goes out and you wake up in your bed but everything is different. Where are you? Why are you there?<br /><br />2. Without telling you your best friend has entered your manuscript in a contest which you win. What is your reaction? Are you still friends?<br /><br />3. &nbsp;Where was your favorite place to read as a child? Is it still the same as an adult? Why or why not?<br /><br />4. You receive a letter in the mail from yourself five years ago. What does it say?<br /><br />5. Describe the day you spent with the protagonist pf your favorite novel. (If picking a favorite is too difficult use the protagonist of the novel you are currently reading.)<br /><br />6. If you were allowed to commit a crime which would you choose? Explain.<br /><br />7. You are two days from your wedding. Your significant other's phone is exactly the same as yours. When you reach to answer it a voice on the other end warns you that seven years of turmoil await you. Do you go through with the wedding?<br /><br />8. Write about the perfect day.<br /><br />9. Show me a day without coffee.<br /><br />10. Personify the fruits of the spirit. They are love,joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control.<br /><br /><br />I hope these spark your imaginations as you put pen to paper.</div>
