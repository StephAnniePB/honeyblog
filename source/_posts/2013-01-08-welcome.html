Eating the Honey of Words is meant to document my journey as a writer as I begin the long climb to graduate school. Currently I am enrolled at Madison College as a Liberal Arts Transfer Student. I will receive my Associate of Arts Degree in December 2013. Then I will head to UW-Madison for my degrees in Creative Writing, Spanish and Non-Profit Organizational Leadership. I plan to attend graduate school at the University of New Orleans for Creative Writing and Spanish. It's a dizzying thought right now as I am at the first plateau.<br />Climbing to this first plateau has been an amazing adventure. I have wrestled with Cerebral Palsy and waged war with Lupus; I have began cleansing the wounds of abuse and neglect left by foster care and two failed adoptions. I am proof that a person can thrive even after experiencing the land of no expectations. I hope my &nbsp;stories will inspire you to climb your own mountain and reach many different plateaus.<br />Blessings,<br />Soulful Poet<br /><br /></div>
