<b><u>Day 6: August 30th 2014</u></b><br /><b><u><br /></u></b>As this beautiful Saturday draws to a close I find myself happy and smiling. That is all the gratitude right there. So much pain pressed upon my shoulders that I rarely get the chance to remove the labels on me. Today I was just me and happy.</div>
