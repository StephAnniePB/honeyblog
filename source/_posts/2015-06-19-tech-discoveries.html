Yesterday I learned some new things that I can add to my tech bag and I was reminded of some old favorites. The academy reminded me of Google Docs. I am still working on learning my way around this feature being that I am old school. Meaning I like carrying flash drives around on my key chain. &nbsp;I learned about Trello and Harvest. I learned about Slacker and played around with my Mac AirBook. I really like that we use Mac in class because it gives me an opportunity to familiarize myself with the system and build a new skill. <br />The opportunity to learn new skills is what attracted me to this program. Yesterday Lupus reared its ugly head and I had to leave class early. &nbsp;I think that I will have to develop a new self-care plan so that I can make it through this class.<br />Before class we discuss what blockers we are facing that could hinder our progress for me that is knowing that my housing is secure. Part of my wanting to be in this class is to get a solid foundation into society. I have lived on the fringes of society my entire life. This class will help me get a career that will allow me to get off of SSI and continue to move towards freedom.<br />Today I returned to class with a box of mint cookies to calm my stomach. I seem to be holding my own now. It is the end of the first week and I can't wait to see what the future holds.</div>
