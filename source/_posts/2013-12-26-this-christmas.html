This Christmas the gifts of love and friendship were shared within my circle. December saw me staying closer to home than I have been for many years and as a result I was unable to make my usual pilgrimage to Sheboygan. At first, I was bummed about this but, as Mama used to say, the Lord works in mysterious ways. Staying close to home this year allowed me to glimpse the gifts of friendship and love through a different lens. First, two weeks before Christmas, a friend dropped by to help me put up my tree. It was comical, really, because I am four feet eleven inches tall and my tree tops out at seven feet. This means that my friend decorated while I simply handed him the purple and silver ornaments.<br />\Then, Christmas cards began arriving in the mail from my friends' family. It was so awesome to open the mail and see hand-written envelops addressed to me. &nbsp;The cards made me feel as if I were a part of Christmas in Sheboygan though I was in Madison. On top of that my friends sent me a small care package.<br />I smiled and placed this under the tree next to the Complete Sherlock Holmes Mysteries. Weeks seem to fly by and before I knew it Christmas Eve was upon us. That night I prepared a marinade for the chicken I would fry for Christmas Day and afterwards I climbed into bed. Since I am a big kid at heart it did not surprise me that sleep was elusive.<br />Christmas arrived and I set to preparing a feast for my best friend and I. It was such a treat to have her all to myself for two days without the usual concerns getting in the way. We ate, played Scrabble, laughed and laughed some more. These last two days spent with her gave me a glimpse of the possibility of being surrounded by love.<br />Life has not always been kind to either of us and it was nice to realize that we could meet each other at our points of need and keep the nightmares at bay.<br />This Christmas my cup runneth over with love and friendship.</div>
