Minds meeting in a tight space pressed between who we are and who we wish to be. A smoother, richer, darker place; can this soft-hearted gangster keep my pace?<br /><div>Beyond being top to my bottom or bottom to my top; can he cause me to enter subspace without removing my clothes? Caress my mind until my soul glows......<br /><br />Minds meeting in a tight space pressed between where we are and where we wish to be.&nbsp;A smoother, richer, darker place; can this soft-hearted gangster see me? <br />Can he honor my requst for time alone; will he allow himself to be my home? Respect these steps taken towards&nbsp;our future; proudly standing at my side?<br /><br />My tongue trips upon itself as I feel these syllables recede to breath. Henessy Black warms my belly and I turn myself towards life's stage seeking to understand my choice.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</div></div>
