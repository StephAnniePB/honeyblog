<span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Ancestors answered. Their words rooted in me. Food for when I have none. Fed from the fruits of their spirits. Led by voices that whisper. Acknowledging I must be still to hear it.&nbsp;</span><br style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;" /><span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18px;">Ancestors answered. Hours spent digesting their scrolls. Turning thoughts into action with pen strokes across life's page. Ancestors answered as I stand in the gap. Nourished from their sorrows and strengthened by their triumphs. On their shoulders I stand.</span></div>
