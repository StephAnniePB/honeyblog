<br />My mission is simple: Live a healthy, stable, productive life through nutritional, physical, emotional, mental and fiscal responsibility.<br /><br />Nutritional Responsibility means continuing to choose healthy clean organic food to create flavorful delicious meals daily. Personally I have found I am a person who requires breakfast to be substantial but lunch and dinner may be lighter. Also snacking during the day is acceptable as long as the snacks are healthier for me.<br /><br />Physical Responsibility means continuing to take my Lupus medication as prescribed. It also means allowing myself rest when I am tired and finding ways to incorporate swimming and walking into my daily routine. The ability to renew my Princeton Club membership will assist greatly in this.<br /><br />Emotional/Mental Responsibility means continuing to communicate my truth through writing. It also means continuing to work on my memoir as well as the fiction piece I have started. In addition I would like to start building a stronger presence on my blog and I would like to build community in Madison until such time that I am able to relocate to the DC area and pursue my dream of becoming a librarian at the Library of Congress. I would also like to continue learning about my past especially as it pertains to my parents. It is past time for their faces to have names.<br /><br />Fiscal Responsibility means continuing to pay off debts both school and personal. Continuing to stick to my budget. Finding employment which will allow me to establish and maintain investments which can be passed from generation to generation.<br /><br />The Strategic Plan for this mission is broken down into three year increments and each area of my mission has its goals and details included. I have always liked lists because you can cross them off and though my affinity for numbers is nowhere near what I have for words; I like that when you are careful numbers do not lie. I have always been a person with big dreams and to ensure that I reach them I want to establish ways to hold myself accountable. This mission and the three year strategic plan will insure I remain accountable to myself in all areas of my life. </div>
