Fertilize tiny seeds of conversation<br />Ferment ideas with hopes and dreams<br />Seek what lies below the A-horizon<br />Plumb the depths of my mind with inquiries<br />Ask what countries I want to see; what languages I speak<br />Challenge me to continue becoming my highest self.<br /><br />When you reach the B-horizon<br />Fertilize me with bone meal<br />Seek to speak my love language<br />Learn why Sundays are my favorite<br />Know that what I ask of you I ask of myself first<br /><br />At the C-horizon<br />Become my partner in peace<br />Let us agree to never take things personally<br />Let us speak with integrity<br />In our ecosystem our word is bond<br /><br />Let us create an environment where kindness and compassion<br />cross-pollinate with strength and ingenuity<br />Where seeds of knowledge become sprouts of wisdom harvested at the appointed time<br />Where the branches of our family tree drop fruits of the spirit in June<br /><br />Imagine answering the ancestors call<br />Let us rebuild<br />My heart swears we can have it all<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
