Dr. Cornel West helped me define my melancholia!! I defined my melancholia as being trapped in a system not designed to ensure my independence. This definition is true but it is too narrow to define the shift happening in me on both a mental and physical level. Years ago, before I ever picked up The Trial of Socrates, I vowed to fall in love with Jesus. I felt that I needed to deepen my faith because I sensed a change was coming and the tools I &nbsp;had been using to live off of where&nbsp;inadequate. I knew that this request would mean my already difficult life could and would become impossible but I allowed my pen to meet paper and asked to fall in love.<br />A few years later I became a student in the UW Odyssey Project where I was re-introduced to Socrates through the work of Plato. I read Plato's words and immediately saw parallels between Socrates and Jesus; realizing that it was not enough to ask to fall in love with Jesus I amended my request asking to become a lover of truth and wisdom.<br />This request opened the door to melancholia because it forced me to see the areas of my life that I hadn't examined. Then, in Fall 2011 Lupus returned and I spent two weeks in the hospital fighting for my life. Upon my release I was faced with the concept of self-care as well as the prospect of building a life here in Madison. In January 2012 I finally stopped fighting the need of my pen to press my story to a page and began working on my memoir.<br />Twenty-four pages into&nbsp;Ammonia, Medicine, and Fear melancholia presses upon me again. This time because I realize that cleaning the wounds of abandonment, abuse and neglect is not a one-time process; it's a lifetime process. Some of these wounds flare-up at the oddest times recently the wounds of abandonment and neglect have flared.<br />I am very social; those who know me will tell you that few things make me happier than having a houseful of people over for dinner and a movie. However, recently I have found myself in a position of questioning the company I keep. This questioning has led me to&nbsp;significantly reduce the number of people around me opening old wounds.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><div><br /></div></div>
