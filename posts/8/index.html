Dr. Cornel West helped me define my melancholia!! I defined my melancholia as being trapped in a system not designed to ensure my independence. This definition is true but it is too narrow to define the shift happening in me on both a mental and physical level. Years ago, before I ever picked up The Trial of Socrates, I vowed to fall in love with Jesus. I felt that I needed to deepen my faith because I sensed a change was coming and the tools I &nbsp;had been using to live off of where&nbsp;inadequate. I knew that this request would mean my already difficult life could and would become impossible but I allowed my pen to meet paper and asked to fall in love.<br />A few years later I became a student in the UW Odyssey Project where I was re-introduced to Socrates through the work of Plato. I read Plato's words and immediately saw parallels between Socrates and Jesus; realizing that it was not enough to ask to fall in love with Jesus I amended my request asking to become a lover of truth and wisdom.<br />This request opened the door to melancholia because it forced me to see the areas of my life that I hadn't examined. Then, in Fall 2011 Lupus returned and I spent two weeks in the hospital fighting for my life. Upon my release I was faced with the concept of self-care as well as the prospect of building a life here in Madison. In January 2012 I finally stopped fighting the need of my pen to press my story to a page and began working on my memoir.<br />Twenty-four pages into&nbsp;Ammonia, Medicine, and Fear melancholia presses upon me again. This time because I realize that cleaning the wounds of abandonment, abuse and neglect is not a one-time process; it's a lifetime process. Some of these wounds flare-up at the oddest times recently the wounds of abandonment and neglect have flared.<br />I am very social; those who know me will tell you that few things make me happier than having a houseful of people over for dinner and a movie. However, recently I have found myself in a position of questioning the company I keep. This questioning has led me to&nbsp;significantly reduce the number of people around me opening old wounds.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><div><br /></div></div>

Yesterday was&nbsp;the second day of the Spring semester at Madison College and though I am tired I feel a sense of elation because I have two more semesters to complete before I reach the first plateau on this climb towards independence. I've been in a bit of a funk lately and it feels good to have something else to concentrate on but the funk still lingers.<br />It started last Friday when I raced home from a friend's house to greet my social worker at my door for our ten o'clock appointment. I do not like these appointments because they consist of a stranger entering my apartment and passing judgement on my life which she knows little to nothing about. My apartment looked like a war zone. Actually it looked like a&nbsp;manifestation of my depression but more about that later. As I saying she met me at the door&nbsp;and I let her in. I offered her the chair closet to the door and I took the one across from her at my kitchen table. Then she looked around and was like 'Are you sure you don't someone to come in and help you clean?'<br />I had to bite the inside of my mouth to keep from reminding her that I'd tired that once and I am still recovering from that mistake. I shook my head no; glad that I had school to fall back on. I told her that since I was always at school I wouldn't feel right asking them to pay for someone to come to my home when I am not there. There was a pause and then since she couldn't argue with my logic she changed the subject. The remainder of the visit passed without my spider-sense tingling until she asked about my ability to keep my apartment.<br />Again, I bit my tongue and said very little. Finally, she got the idea that I wasn't going to tell her anything and so she left saying the next time we meet it'd be at Madison College. I assured her I'd be there and closed the door.<br />Doors swishing shut brought me&nbsp;melancholy and produced a funk that lingered into Sunday morning causing me to create a Sunday Morning Playlist on Spotify. I filled it with music I hadn't heard since I felt the warmth of the Georgia sun. Eventually the melancholia lifted and I realized that its coming was rooted in the realization that currently I am operating within a system that is not created for me to experience and/or have independence.</div>

The battle for independence has ever been a difficult one as you&#39;re well aware. when I think of your fight and mine I remember too that we are the descendants of leaders and warriors. We were built for the battles we face, placed strategically by our supreme commander at the precise time and in the exact location in which we are needed and can be most effective. the melancholy you feel is a tangible manifestation of the cosmic discord felt by the prophets of old and by Jesus himself. Its presence speaks of your origins and spurs your efforts to be  part of reconciling the world as we know it with the world as it is meant to be. </div>

My past called me on Monday night when I was in Urgent Care waiting to see if my friend had pneumonia. I was trying to keep my mind off of my intense dislike of hospitals and clinics praying for a suitable distraction but I didn't count on this.<br /><div>My relationship with Mr. Eastside has inspired poems such as "Hennessy&nbsp;No Ice" and "Just Thinking" both of which I will be posting on this blog momentarily. Dancing with him became difficult when he refused to take the lead. Several months of trying to learn his&nbsp;rhythms left me exhausted with nothing but tears to show for my troubles.&nbsp;</div><div>Growing up in foster care did not give me a lot of positive role models or examples of positive relationships as a result I vowed that my relationships would not only be different but polar opposite. I stepped on the dance floor with Mr. Eastside determined to communicate honestly and override my instinct to do things on my own.&nbsp;</div><div>When he first started pursuing me I didn't think he was serious. My experience with the opposite sex had been strictly in the crush or friend-zone. At thi ty-one I hadn't found anyone who would attempt learning my rhythms. I had just begun being comfortable with the fact that my life would be a solo endeavor. I would be surrounded by wonderful friends but no one would know me intimately because they let the walker and the fact I have Cerebral Palsy scare them.</div><div>Mr. Eastside was different he wasn't fazed by the walker and Cerebral Palsy didn't seem to faze him either. He continued to pursue me and after a few months I accepted his invitation to dinner. I thought I was being clear with him. I was very forthcoming with him over the span of some months. I had made up my mind that if God granted me a relationship I would do my very best to love and cherish that person.<br />Unfortunately Mr. Eastside did not share the same mindset. Somehow when I told him my&nbsp;story he heard echoes of his ex-wife and he assumed I was just like her.<br />In my desire to prove I was nothing like her I didn't call him on certain things I wouldn't let another person do to me. I also couldn't escape the insecurities spawned by surviving foster care for sixteen years and I was very needy.<br />Mr. Eastside took my kindness for weakness and when I couldn't take anymore he left me sobbing on my living room floor. &nbsp;When I picked myself up off the floor I decided I would take the lessons this relationship had taught me and become better.<br />Mr. Eastside showed me where various&nbsp;vulnerabilities were in the strength I present to the outside world. I learned that I must develop my self-esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;I also learned that I must surround myself with people and things that inspire me.<br />My past called me on Monday and I watched the young lady I used to be drown. I gathered my strength knowing on Friday I'll change my number.</div></div>

Eating the Honey of Words is meant to document my journey as a writer as I begin the long climb to graduate school. Currently I am enrolled at Madison College as a Liberal Arts Transfer Student. I will receive my Associate of Arts Degree in December 2013. Then I will head to UW-Madison for my degrees in Creative Writing, Spanish and Non-Profit Organizational Leadership. I plan to attend graduate school at the University of New Orleans for Creative Writing and Spanish. It's a dizzying thought right now as I am at the first plateau.<br />Climbing to this first plateau has been an amazing adventure. I have wrestled with Cerebral Palsy and waged war with Lupus; I have began cleansing the wounds of abuse and neglect left by foster care and two failed adoptions. I am proof that a person can thrive even after experiencing the land of no expectations. I hope my &nbsp;stories will inspire you to climb your own mountain and reach many different plateaus.<br />Blessings,<br />Soulful Poet<br /><br /></div>
