<span style="font-family: inherit;">One of my best friends tagged me in something she termed a "game" on Facebook. The objective is to post three things you are grateful for everyday for seven days. Others may view this as a game but I take it very seriously. I quickly realized how this practice would be beneficial to my life especially as I am in a holding pattern in a lot of areas right now. I have never been a patient person in terms of waiting for things and these daily gratitudes are slowing me down; causing me to look at the gifts that have already been given to me. I am on day five. Below are my gratitudes so far:</span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><u><b>Day 1: August 25th 2014</b></u>&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">1. Thankful for best friends who help you fill out college applications at midnight as you mutter under breath because they want information about people who are not your parents.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;">2.

I want to be purposefully reminded of the gifts hidden inside everyday.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: inherit;"><span style="background-color: white; color: #37404e; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px;"><u><b><br /></b></u></span></span></div>

<br />My mission is simple: Live a healthy, stable, productive life through nutritional, physical, emotional, mental and fiscal responsibility.<br /><br />Nutritional Responsibility means continuing to choose healthy clean organic food to create flavorful delicious meals daily. Personally I have found I am a person who requires breakfast to be substantial but lunch and dinner may be lighter. Also snacking during the day is acceptable as long as the snacks are healthier for me.<br /><br />Physical Responsibility means continuing to take my Lupus medication as prescribed. It also means allowing myself rest when I am tired and finding ways to incorporate swimming and walking into my daily routine. The ability to renew my Princeton Club membership will assist greatly in this.<br /><br />Emotional/Mental Responsibility means continuing to communicate my truth through writing. It also means continuing to work on my memoir as well as the fiction piece I have started. In addition I would like to start building a stronger presence on my blog and I would like to build community in Madison until such time that I am able to relocate to the DC area and pursue my dream of becoming a librarian at the Library of Congress. I would also like to continue learning about my past especially as it pertains to my parents. It is past time for their faces to have names.<br /><br />Fiscal Responsibility means continuing to pay off debts both school and personal. Continuing to stick to my budget. Finding employment which will allow me to establish and maintain investments which can be passed from generation to generation.<br /><br />The Strategic Plan for this mission is broken down into three year increments and each area of my mission has its goals and details included. I have always liked lists because you can cross them off and though my affinity for numbers is nowhere near what I have for words; I like that when you are careful numbers do not lie. I have always been a person with big dreams and to ensure that I reach them I want to establish ways to hold myself accountable. This mission and the three year strategic plan will insure I remain accountable to myself in all areas of my life. </div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">This February I am giving myself the ultimate gift; I am changing my name. Shedding the last vestiges of abuse and returning to my roots. I was born July 26th 1979 in Atlanta, Ga. and given the name Stephanie Ann Brown. At ten, when I was forced to take the surname of Pamperin I vowed that one day I would return myself to my rightful name and find my family. It has been a long journey but this February I get to keep my vow.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"><o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Returning to my original name will enable me to finally get the records that the State of Ga. has on me without having to go there and physically get them. Not that I have a problem returning to the city of my birth but all my efforts to do so have been thwarted and so I have devised another way. In 2008 when I learned I have Lupus and that it is hereditary possible scenarios of how I became a ward of the state of Ga. begin marinating in my mind. It is my current belief that my mother had Lupus and it caused complications which led to me being born with Cerebral Palsy. I have always believed that something happened to my parents which prevented them from attending the court session that led to the revocation of their parental rights.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">I am both excited and terrified to see if my theories are correct. I want to know the truth of what happened but I also want the two pictures I have of my parents to be more than images of nameless strangers.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 13.5pt;">Either way in February I will file for the name change and begin the discovery of my roots.<o:p></o:p></span></div></div>

There are those who will tell you that playing is just for children but I disagree. As a writer I have strengthened my skill and customized my craft by playing Scrabble, Boggle, Banana Grams, &nbsp;Words with Friends and Alpha Jax. These games when played with the right opponent can increase vocabulary and give you a bigger arsenal for writing. <br />Other games like Story Cubes, Dinner Box of Questions, and Loaded Questions are all good games for sparking the mind enough to put pen to paper. Plus, you can use each of these individually or with a group.<br />Don't underestimate the power of play when it comes to writing and remember to have fun regardless of whether you choose to put pen to paper.</div>

I have yet to meet a writer who hasn't come up against the mental prison known as writer's block. For me writer's block isn't a lack of ideas, it's wanting everything laid out perfectly in my mind before pressing pen to paper. The fact that that never happens can cause me not to want to sit down and bleed during the time it takes to complete one page. However, I found that writing prompts can take me out of my head and away from the need for perfection. I have come up with my own set of prompts. Feel free to use them for your own and if you come up with more let me know.<br /><br />1. Your power goes out and you wake up in your bed but everything is different. Where are you? Why are you there?<br /><br />2. Without telling you your best friend has entered your manuscript in a contest which you win. What is your reaction? Are you still friends?<br /><br />3. &nbsp;Where was your favorite place to read as a child? Is it still the same as an adult? Why or why not?<br /><br />4. You receive a letter in the mail from yourself five years ago. What does it say?<br /><br />5. Describe the day you spent with the protagonist pf your favorite novel. (If picking a favorite is too difficult use the protagonist of the novel you are currently reading.)<br /><br />6. If you were allowed to commit a crime which would you choose? Explain.<br /><br />7. You are two days from your wedding. Your significant other's phone is exactly the same as yours. When you reach to answer it a voice on the other end warns you that seven years of turmoil await you. Do you go through with the wedding?<br /><br />8. Write about the perfect day.<br /><br />9. Show me a day without coffee.<br /><br />10. Personify the fruits of the spirit. They are love,joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness, and self-control.<br /><br /><br />I hope these spark your imaginations as you put pen to paper.</div>

Today, we lost a Poet. This truth teller told us to unplug from the Matrix long before Hollywood.<br />He put pen to paper to tell us Black is beautiful. Black is bold. Black is resistance. Black is fearless. Black is revolution.<br />Today we lost a Poet. A prophet who like so many was silenced because he refused the status quo. &nbsp;Ancestor those of us who know you stood in the gap for us say thank you. Thank you for being fearlessly strong. May the ancestors welcome you home.<br />Today, we lost a Poet.</div>
