Today marks the sixth year anniversary of my move to Madison. Six years; wow! Time has definitely flown and though not all of it was fun it did lead to my being able to have a home. As I sit in my living room enjoying the first day of 2014 I am pleased and excited that I get to continue shaping this space into something that says "mine."<br />In my minds eye I see the remaining bookshelves assembled and arranged. I see two comfortable soft leather chairs and lamps admitting soft light into the room. Lots of throws and blankets. The posters on the wall are inspiring something that makes you smile and think when you see them.<br />It will be tastefully simple when it is all completed and the best part is it should keep me busy until I return to school in August.<br />Other projects include returning my name back to that which my parents gave me and stepping up my efforts to find them. It is past time for the two strangers in the photographs I have to be named.<br />Then, there is writing. My goal in this arena is very simple I would like to take this year and finish my memoir. It's odd to say that because technically I will only finish it when I am no longer breathing as it is the story of my life. I feel that I can bring it to a closing when I graduate with my degree from the university of my choice. If I can complete what is already a six thousand word manuscript this year then next year I can begin the search for publication.<br />To help me stick to writing everyday I have joined a group on Facebook where I will be held accountable for writing my memoir daily.<br />Other goals in this arena include writing in this blog daily. On January 1st 2015 I want to be able to see 364 days of blogging here. There is never a shortage of things to write about so I feel confident that I can do it.<br />Other than that I am looking forward to the joy, surprises and lessons of 2014.<br /><br /></div>

The perfect Saturday has eluded me lately. Mostly because without my medicine all my body wants to do is sleep. &nbsp;Hopefully the insurance fiasco will be sorted soon and I will be able to resume my life as a student. Until then days like these are golden. I had the perfect Saturday. Classical music and light jazz. Pumpkin Spice Chai tea and a brand new volume of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's the Complete Sherlock Holmes. The best part was that I did not have to leave my house to have such a luxurious day. Another wonderful thing was that a friend dropped by but instead of expecting to be entertained he brought a book with him and read while I read mine. It was awesome. I do not have many friends with whom I could have experienced a day like today.<br />This Saturday gave me a glimpse into how I want to spend many more days.</div>

This Christmas the gifts of love and friendship were shared within my circle. December saw me staying closer to home than I have been for many years and as a result I was unable to make my usual pilgrimage to Sheboygan. At first, I was bummed about this but, as Mama used to say, the Lord works in mysterious ways. Staying close to home this year allowed me to glimpse the gifts of friendship and love through a different lens. First, two weeks before Christmas, a friend dropped by to help me put up my tree. It was comical, really, because I am four feet eleven inches tall and my tree tops out at seven feet. This means that my friend decorated while I simply handed him the purple and silver ornaments.<br />\Then, Christmas cards began arriving in the mail from my friends' family. It was so awesome to open the mail and see hand-written envelops addressed to me. &nbsp;The cards made me feel as if I were a part of Christmas in Sheboygan though I was in Madison. On top of that my friends sent me a small care package.<br />I smiled and placed this under the tree next to the Complete Sherlock Holmes Mysteries. Weeks seem to fly by and before I knew it Christmas Eve was upon us. That night I prepared a marinade for the chicken I would fry for Christmas Day and afterwards I climbed into bed. Since I am a big kid at heart it did not surprise me that sleep was elusive.<br />Christmas arrived and I set to preparing a feast for my best friend and I. It was such a treat to have her all to myself for two days without the usual concerns getting in the way. We ate, played Scrabble, laughed and laughed some more. These last two days spent with her gave me a glimpse of the possibility of being surrounded by love.<br />Life has not always been kind to either of us and it was nice to realize that we could meet each other at our points of need and keep the nightmares at bay.<br />This Christmas my cup runneth over with love and friendship.</div>

I do not have television which means that I am rarely accosted by the media and what they call news. However I do have a computer with internet access and I also have a Facebook page which is filled with other pages that I really like, for example The Daily Show. Recently they have been discussing the war on Christmas and the remarks of some of the big network anchormen and women.<br />Now, just for the record, for me the mythical Santa Claus has always been a black man. When I was a little girl I slipped downstairs and watched "Santa" pull toys and other treats from his big red sack. This memory and many more are gold threads in my life's tapestry and even when I lost my community at age nine I never lost the truth about myself or my people.<br />Let's be honest, the fact that major network anchors are concerned about the ethnicity of "Santa" is as laughable as it is disturbing. More disturbing however is the fact that an anchor person is allowed to say the following words "Just because it makes you feel uncomfortable, doesn't mean it has to change." without anyone except Comedy Central's Jon Stewart holding the person accountable for their words. Americans need to do better.</div>

Today December 5th 2013 is the anniversary the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Sparked by Mrs. Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on a city bus and her arrest for the refusal on December 1st 1955. On this day in 1955 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Reverend Ralph Abernathy along with countless others began a crusade to end segregation on the Montgomery City buses. The endeavor would last thirteen months ending with the US Supreme Court decision that segregated buses were unconstitutional. <br />Being from Atlanta Ga. evidence of Dr. King's legacy was woven into the fabric of my childhood. Mama would often tell me how blessed I was to be able to ride in the front of the Marta to and from school everyday. Every January for nine years the movie KING gave me a glimpse of those in the struggle and the words of Dr. King's Dream.<br />At the same time as the words of Dr. King's Dream were being woven into my life's tapestry so was the struggle of Mr. Nelson Mandela. He went home to glory today and through the tears that burned my eyes and clogged my throat I could hear the ancestors welcoming him home.<br />The trumpet sound filled my ears and I knew he had fulfilled his purpose and answered the ancestors call.<br />Then I paused and thought of my journey. How have I answered the ancestor's call? Am I being quiet enough to hear their voices? Have I been brave enough to heed their warnings in spite of the fear I often feel? Then I realize I am fighting; I will fight; I have fought. &nbsp;I am still fighting.</div>

Today December 4th marks the anniversary of the deaths of Chairman Fred Hampton Sr and Mark Clark. These men were members of the Black Panther Party. It is 2013 and I cannot help but notice that we are still fighting the same battles. We are still fighting for housing; medical care; living wages; education- both primary and secondary. I say "we" because I am a part of the collective and as such we are still fighting. However, I am saddened because I recognize that a lot of the places we in the black community previously turned to for guidance have been inhaled by capitalism. Even as I shake my head at this predicament I know I cannot quit. The places from which I draw strength are not the same as they were in childhood and often times it feels like I am alone. Then the anniversary of something like this happens and I remember whose blood is running through my veins. We are still fighting. We will still fight. We have always fought.</div>

I am a writer which means I have been blessed with the ability to live life twice. I have also been blessed with the ability to live lives other than my own simply by picking up a book or pressing pen to paper. However, my recent project is not one that allows me to escape the confines of my reality. My recent project is a memoir which is forcing me to deal with wound cleaning. Over the years I have tired many things to clean and heal the wounds of abandonment, abuse and neglect; each method has had varying degrees of success. I must say that putting pen to paper has given me a peace few other things have. Writing my memoir has put me back in touch with the pieces of myself that I thought were eaten away in the wake of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. This process has finally allowed me to have my say. State how the world is for me on a daily basis and not just expose the darkness but remember where I find the light.<br />I realized that my being able to survive the darkness had everything to do with where I found the light. An abusive situation meant to punish actually allowed me to read and re-read The Bible; in turn giving me the ability at an early age to decide what kind of person I wanted to become. Books have always been a source of light to me.<br />As I cleanse my wounds and tell the story of me I am realizing that it is as much a love letter to the authors, poets, and musicians whose work remains with me as it is to myself. It is my acknowledgement that fair did not show up at the table. It is also my acknowledgement that I continue to be strong enough to be my own champion.<br />For that knowledge I am blessed and I continue to work through the wounds so I may make the journey easier for another.</div>

Begin with a large hot skillet; northerners know these as frying pans. Add spinach leaves and sliced mushrooms. Throw in some onion and stir until the pan is happy. You will know this because the pan will sizzle and your kitchen will smell like the wilderness mixed with butter and seasonings. Always use salt and pepper when preparing food this ensures that you will not need salt and pepper shakers at the dinner table. Cook the mixture until the onions are translucent; the spinach is wilted and the mushrooms are brown. &nbsp;Now I had some left over chicken drumsticks which I de-boned and &nbsp;added into the mixture. I was going to put it over rice but then I decided I wanted pasta instead. I cooked the penne noodles and then I added the mixture and to that I added two cans of tomato sauce and one can of tomato paste.&nbsp;<div>This Saturday Lunch was a hug from the inside out. My kitchen is sanctuary. It doesn't mind if I re-enter it after five minutes or two days. I know that I can enter in and release the stress of a day or a week without judgement. Here, I know that if I put milk in a saucepan on a low simmer and add cocoa powder and peppermint with a little water I will have a drinking chocolate better than any on the market.&nbsp;</div><div>Here, I do not have to worry about whispers or stares. I can take my time; work at my pace. Here, I know that if I let butter soften and mix it with granulated sugar I have the beginnings of the softest chocolate chip cookies. I love knowing that when I follow a recipe that I have committed to memory I get exactly what I want.</div><div>I have been thinking more and more about what I want my life to be. Actually I have been realizing that my life no longer has to be something I didn't choose. I choose to surround myself with books, music, and movies. I choose to write daily and spend as much time in my kitchen as possible. I choose to live quietly surrounded by those who will give me hugs when I need them whether I ask or not.&nbsp;</div><div>I am learning to nurture the peace, love and happiness inside.</div></div>
