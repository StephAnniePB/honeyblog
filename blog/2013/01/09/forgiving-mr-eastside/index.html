<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
My past called me on Monday night when I was in Urgent Care waiting to see if my friend had pneumonia. I was trying to keep my mind off of my intense dislike of hospitals and clinics praying for a suitable distraction but I didn't count on this.<br /><div>My relationship with Mr. Eastside has inspired poems such as "Hennessy&nbsp;No Ice" and "Just Thinking" both of which I will be posting on this blog momentarily. Dancing with him became difficult when he refused to take the lead. Several months of trying to learn his&nbsp;rhythms left me exhausted with nothing but tears to show for my troubles.&nbsp;</div><div>Growing up in foster care did not give me a lot of positive role models or examples of positive relationships as a result I vowed that my relationships would not only be different but polar opposite. I stepped on the dance floor with Mr. Eastside determined to communicate honestly and override my instinct to do things on my own.&nbsp;</div><div>When he first started pursuing me I didn't think he was serious. My experience with the opposite sex had been strictly in the crush or friend-zone. At thi ty-one I hadn't found anyone who would attempt learning my rhythms. I had just begun being comfortable with the fact that my life would be a solo endeavor. I would be surrounded by wonderful friends but no one would know me intimately because they let the walker and the fact I have Cerebral Palsy scare them.</div><div>Mr. Eastside was different he wasn't fazed by the walker and Cerebral Palsy didn't seem to faze him either. He continued to pursue me and after a few months I accepted his invitation to dinner. I thought I was being clear with him. I was very forthcoming with him over the span of some months. I had made up my mind that if God granted me a relationship I would do my very best to love and cherish that person.<br />Unfortunately Mr. Eastside did not share the same mindset. Somehow when I told him my&nbsp;story he heard echoes of his ex-wife and he assumed I was just like her.<br />In my desire to prove I was nothing like her I didn't call him on certain things I wouldn't let another person do to me. I also couldn't escape the insecurities spawned by surviving foster care for sixteen years and I was very needy.<br />Mr. Eastside took my kindness for weakness and when I couldn't take anymore he left me sobbing on my living room floor. &nbsp;When I picked myself up off the floor I decided I would take the lessons this relationship had taught me and become better.<br />Mr. Eastside showed me where various&nbsp;vulnerabilities were in the strength I present to the outside world. I learned that I must develop my self-esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;I also learned that I must surround myself with people and things that inspire me.<br />My past called me on Monday and I watched the young lady I used to be drown. I gathered my strength knowing on Friday I'll change my number.</div></div>
