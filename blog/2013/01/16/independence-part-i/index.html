<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Yesterday was&nbsp;the second day of the Spring semester at Madison College and though I am tired I feel a sense of elation because I have two more semesters to complete before I reach the first plateau on this climb towards independence. I've been in a bit of a funk lately and it feels good to have something else to concentrate on but the funk still lingers.<br />It started last Friday when I raced home from a friend's house to greet my social worker at my door for our ten o'clock appointment. I do not like these appointments because they consist of a stranger entering my apartment and passing judgement on my life which she knows little to nothing about. My apartment looked like a war zone. Actually it looked like a&nbsp;manifestation of my depression but more about that later. As I saying she met me at the door&nbsp;and I let her in. I offered her the chair closet to the door and I took the one across from her at my kitchen table. Then she looked around and was like 'Are you sure you don't someone to come in and help you clean?'<br />I had to bite the inside of my mouth to keep from reminding her that I'd tired that once and I am still recovering from that mistake. I shook my head no; glad that I had school to fall back on. I told her that since I was always at school I wouldn't feel right asking them to pay for someone to come to my home when I am not there. There was a pause and then since she couldn't argue with my logic she changed the subject. The remainder of the visit passed without my spider-sense tingling until she asked about my ability to keep my apartment.<br />Again, I bit my tongue and said very little. Finally, she got the idea that I wasn't going to tell her anything and so she left saying the next time we meet it'd be at Madison College. I assured her I'd be there and closed the door.<br />Doors swishing shut brought me&nbsp;melancholy and produced a funk that lingered into Sunday morning causing me to create a Sunday Morning Playlist on Spotify. I filled it with music I hadn't heard since I felt the warmth of the Georgia sun. Eventually the melancholia lifted and I realized that its coming was rooted in the realization that currently I am operating within a system that is not created for me to experience and/or have independence.</div>

The battle for independence has ever been a difficult one as you&#39;re well aware. when I think of your fight and mine I remember too that we are the descendants of leaders and warriors. We were built for the battles we face, placed strategically by our supreme commander at the precise time and in the exact location in which we are needed and can be most effective. the melancholy you feel is a tangible manifestation of the cosmic discord felt by the prophets of old and by Jesus himself. Its presence speaks of your origins and spurs your efforts to be  part of reconciling the world as we know it with the world as it is meant to be. </div>
