L-U-P-U-S. This five letter word has been impacting my life for a number of years. Officially diagnosed in 2008 I have refused to let myself acknowledge that things would have to be done differently now that I was a person with both Cerebral Palsy (CP) and Lupus. My limitations with CP are malleable; meaning I can often find ways around them so that I may remain an active and vital part of society. However, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, (SLE), is a whole different animal. Its symptoms include fatigue, rashes, abdominal pain, nausea, joint and muscle pain, hair loss, mouth sores, and many other things. I have suffered from every known symptom of SLE and yet I refused to stop the hectic pace of my life.<br /><div>I told myself that I would slow down once I got my Bachelor's Degree and found the job that would allow me to be free of the United States government. I moved from Lakeland College in Sheboygan to Madison on January 1st 2009. I figured the city would be a much better place for me because of the medical care I could receive at the University of Wisconsin Hospital.&nbsp;</div><div>2009-11 were not peaceful but Lupus was quiet and so I felt that I could pursue my education. Academia had always been my sanctuary. Returning to sanctuary in September 2010 was a challenge however I soon found my rhythm. I was hitting my stride as a full time student when in October 2011 SLE re-directed my life once again. This time in the form of double bronchial pneumonia which resulted in a pulmonary hemorrhage.<br />Of course my doctors decreed that I should leave sanctuary and for the remainder of October until the second week of January I did as they asked. Then January 10th 2012 I returned to sanctuary. I was able to take two classes. I finished that semester with a 4.0 and that summer I got a 3.5.<br />At the end of those two semesters I should have taken a &nbsp;break but I pushed on telling myself that once I reached a landing in this climb I could breathe.<br />Fast forward to now. At the start of this semester I felt drained by the third week of classes. Instead of being excited to be within the walls of academia I was constantly asking "Is it over yet?"<br />Conversations with one of my dearest friends made me question if I was losing my faith. At that point I realized that something had to change. From then on my focus became more about listening to my body and nourishing myself for myself.<br />CP and SLE have given me gifts. The gifts of compassion, faith and hope. The five letter word has given me a confidence that can only come from standing inside the <span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 16px;">furnace of life. The five letter word has thought me not worry about the ones who are afraid to walk with me. Most importantly I have learned that the gifts of faith, compassion, and hope can deepen into something that religion can not give you. I am learning that I do not have to be inside of a church to begin understanding that when I take time to nourish my soul I am enabling the Creator to shape and mold me.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div>
