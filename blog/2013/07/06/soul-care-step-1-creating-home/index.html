<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
&nbsp;In May when I re-signed my lease for the third year I decided to give myself permission to create my home. I realized that my past had created this fear that if I allowed myself to build a home something would happen to destroy it. The years spent bouncing from one place to another had left me with the ability to pack all my belongings in six boxes and little else. My apartment, though beautiful, suffered from neglect and under-use especially during the school year.<br />Attending Madison College was beginning to take its toll emotionally and physically. Just before the school year came to a close my doctor warned me that my Lupus was not doing well and the possibility of undergoing chemotherapy treatments for a second time was very real. He refused to let me attend school for the summer. At first I thought there is no way I'm going to make it an entire summer without having the structure or simulation of school and then my thoughts began to change as I realized the opportunity I would have to finally make my apartment home.<br />The first thing I did was get a proper bed. It is a solid California King heirloom piece made from oak and stained in a dark cherry finish. I love how solid it is and the best part is it was given to me by someone very close to my heart. Eventually I will need to invest in a new mattress and box spring set but for now I am content. I also managed to acquire two dressers which has given me the ability to stop living out of laundry baskets. The final touch to the completion of my bedroom came with my decision to move the entertainment center in there.<br />After completing this renovation I concentrated on cleaning out my spare bedroom and turning it into my office. I moved my desk and bookshelves from the living room and created a cozy space that I use for writing and working on my computer.<br />Both of these projects have caused me to examine a fear that I had and begin working through it. I know there are no guarantees in life and I have decided to live mine without fear. Soul-care is different for everyone and for me it begins with creating a home. I understand that nothing happens overnight and I am sure there will be many hiccups along the way but I have realized that whether I end up going to the University of Georgia or not I still need to nourish my soul.</div>
