Today December 5th 2013 is the anniversary the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Sparked by Mrs. Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on a city bus and her arrest for the refusal on December 1st 1955. On this day in 1955 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Reverend Ralph Abernathy along with countless others began a crusade to end segregation on the Montgomery City buses. The endeavor would last thirteen months ending with the US Supreme Court decision that segregated buses were unconstitutional. <br />Being from Atlanta Ga. evidence of Dr. King's legacy was woven into the fabric of my childhood. Mama would often tell me how blessed I was to be able to ride in the front of the Marta to and from school everyday. Every January for nine years the movie KING gave me a glimpse of those in the struggle and the words of Dr. King's Dream.<br />At the same time as the words of Dr. King's Dream were being woven into my life's tapestry so was the struggle of Mr. Nelson Mandela. He went home to glory today and through the tears that burned my eyes and clogged my throat I could hear the ancestors welcoming him home.<br />The trumpet sound filled my ears and I knew he had fulfilled his purpose and answered the ancestors call.<br />Then I paused and thought of my journey. How have I answered the ancestor's call? Am I being quiet enough to hear their voices? Have I been brave enough to heed their warnings in spite of the fear I often feel? Then I realize I am fighting; I will fight; I have fought. &nbsp;I am still fighting.</div>

Today December 4th marks the anniversary of the deaths of Chairman Fred Hampton Sr and Mark Clark. These men were members of the Black Panther Party. It is 2013 and I cannot help but notice that we are still fighting the same battles. We are still fighting for housing; medical care; living wages; education- both primary and secondary. I say "we" because I am a part of the collective and as such we are still fighting. However, I am saddened because I recognize that a lot of the places we in the black community previously turned to for guidance have been inhaled by capitalism. Even as I shake my head at this predicament I know I cannot quit. The places from which I draw strength are not the same as they were in childhood and often times it feels like I am alone. Then the anniversary of something like this happens and I remember whose blood is running through my veins. We are still fighting. We will still fight. We have always fought.</div>
