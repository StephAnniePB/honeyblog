Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am extremely driven. Being a black woman in America who is differently-abled leaves me no margin of error. I have to be the best because it is the only way I can gain entrance onto a severely slanted playing field. However, the weight of this pressure can cause me to withdraw from people and certain situations. Sometimes when this happens I can be vicious with myself. &nbsp;Telling myself things that if I heard another say to themselves I would admonish them to take it back.<br />I had not really realized that all these months I was required to deal with Lupus and not focus on my passion and purpose I had begun treating myself as the enemy. The fear of another flare had shrunken my world so much that I began thinking I would never....<br />Those three little words are so destructive I hesitate to write them on this page. I am not a woman of fear or doubt. I do not think in that manner. Even as a child when doctors insisted on defining what I could and could not do I was defiant. I have a bucket list that keeps growing as I get older; I speak life to others on a daily basis and yet I could not seem to turn off the negativity inside my head.<br />I knew I was out of control the night I said "Lupus can take me now."<br />I immediately sought the help of a therapist through Catholic Charities. I found that once I was able to articulate my struggles and triumphs to someone aside from my computer my mind started to shift into dreaming again. Dreaming led to planning; planning led to writing down steps which would move me closer to my dream; and this led to me creating daily lists within my phone of tasks to be accomplished.<br />It became easier for me to write about the trauma of my childhood because I had concrete reminders that I was no longer that version of &nbsp;myself. &nbsp;I found that I could write my truth with integrity and not bitterness. Writing was so much a part of me that even when I was not blogging I was writing one word a day. Months went by and slowly three thousand words amassed themselves in ten pages of what is now the fourth draft of my memoir.<br />Recently, I met someone who is constantly providing me with tools to reach my higher self. They challenged me to pay attention to my thoughts and the things I say to myself. It was a difficult realization that I had let the negativity of the past follow me into the present. This realization coupled with a "game" on Facebook sparked the morning and evening gratitudes. As I build myself up again I knew I needed a place I could store them so that if doubt starts to creep in I can shut it down immediately. As I said in one of my earlier posts "having gratitude does not mean life will not hand you lemons; it just means you are better able to make lemonade." Thank you to the person who reminded me of that.<br /><br /></div>
