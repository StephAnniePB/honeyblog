Yesterday I learned some new things that I can add to my tech bag and I was reminded of some old favorites. The academy reminded me of Google Docs. I am still working on learning my way around this feature being that I am old school. Meaning I like carrying flash drives around on my key chain. &nbsp;I learned about Trello and Harvest. I learned about Slacker and played around with my Mac AirBook. I really like that we use Mac in class because it gives me an opportunity to familiarize myself with the system and build a new skill. <br />The opportunity to learn new skills is what attracted me to this program. Yesterday Lupus reared its ugly head and I had to leave class early. &nbsp;I think that I will have to develop a new self-care plan so that I can make it through this class.<br />Before class we discuss what blockers we are facing that could hinder our progress for me that is knowing that my housing is secure. Part of my wanting to be in this class is to get a solid foundation into society. I have lived on the fringes of society my entire life. This class will help me get a career that will allow me to get off of SSI and continue to move towards freedom.<br />Today I returned to class with a box of mint cookies to calm my stomach. I seem to be holding my own now. It is the end of the first week and I can't wait to see what the future holds.</div>

Three days into my YWCA YWEB class and I feel like I might get the hang of this after all. Having never seen this before I am proud I have come this far. It is strange looking at code when you've never seen it before. I am trying to figure out if this is something I can grasp enough to carve out a career or maybe use as a spring board to sustain myself while I continue pursuing my passion. I am a writer first and foremost so it will be interesting to see where this thread takes me.<br />Right now I am wondering if I could benefit from Code Academy or Khan Academy so I can immerse myself in this world.</div>

Anyone who knows me knows I have struggled to answer one question my entire life; "Who am I?" Growing up in two different foster care systems in two different states has left that question echoing in my brain for many years. Tonight I took a gaint step and did a background check on a former foster parent. However after I saw the information I realized that it was only a small sliver of the puzzle and now I find myself at the moment when the truth doesn't answer the questions. The journey continues...............</div>

Today I did it. I sat face to face with a young lady and explained why she would be wise to take a chance on me. I explained that though my journey has not been a straight one&nbsp;I have made the best of every opportunity. Today I did it. I reached a goal and secured a life while knowing there is more to be done. Today I did it..........then there was the pause.<br />The pause whispered "You are not alone." So I took a deep breath and looked up at the sky murmuring thank you. Thank you for hearing me say that I was willing to put in the hard work. Thank you for guarding the dreams, sheltering the hopes and wiping the tears. Thank you; Universe. Thank you; Karma. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</div>

A funny thing happened to me as I was working on my memoir. The story I thought &nbsp;I was writing has morphed into something else. &nbsp;Honestly, my first draft was a temper tantrum on paper and my second draft was not much better. I realize now that those first drafts had to be written to reach the vulnerability beneath. I also realize my mental household is shifting. I am shedding the skin of abuse and neglect on a whole different level.<br />I am grateful for the process; I have faith in the process; I will rise through the process. I am thankful.</div>

<b><u>Day 12: Labor Intense Gratitude</u></b><br />This morning I had watermelon for breakfast and I was instantly happy. Today I spent time researching general information on ways to move closer to the vegetarian side of things. I am already living in that arena now I want to see if I can become a permanent resident. I only allow myself to have meat once a week because I am afraid that my iron levels will be too low if I remove it completely. Also certain times during the week I will crave seafood; especially fish and shrimp. Honestly, one of the reasons I miss the South so much is the fresh catch of the day. Up here those are just words but at home they are a reality. Sigh. Anyways I am still on the fence food wise so I say I am mostly vegetarian.<br />Food aside; today I sent out recommendation requests for my UW application. Now, all I have to do is send in the requests for transcripts and then it is out of my hands. I am relieved and terrified at the same time. I have reservations about the accessibility of campus but I know it is the only place I can go to receive my majors. Plus I am leaning more and more towards library science for graduate school. Deep breath. I have to become an undergrad first. Smiling at myself because I can already see me working and living in D.C. That is the goal.<br />I am proud that I have taken this step towards shaping my reality. There is a lot of hard work ahead of me but I welcome it. I am thankful today was a good productive day. I look forward to tomorrow.</div>
